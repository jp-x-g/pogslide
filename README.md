## pogslide
This is a "GIF Galloper" that turns static images into scrolling animations, using nothing but a single HTML page.

It is pretty self-explanatory, so click the freakin' link and see for yourself.

Note that this will not work with animated GIFs as input (it'll just use a single frame).

TODO:

- Transparency preservation
- Implement directional sliding
